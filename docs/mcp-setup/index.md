# MCP Setup

Configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for design tool integration.

## Available MCP Servers

### [Figma MCP](figma-mcp-setup.md)
Extract design specifications and components from Figma.

**Use when:** Converting Figma designs to requirements or components.

### [Zeplin MCP](zeplin-mcp-setup.md)
Extract design specifications from Zeplin.

**Use when:** Converting Zeplin designs to requirements or components.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows Claude to interact with external services and retrieve design specifications.

## Optional Nature

MCP servers are **optional**. RequireKit works fully without them for text-based requirements.

Use MCPs when you need to:
- Extract requirements from design files
- Generate component specifications from designs
- Maintain design-code consistency

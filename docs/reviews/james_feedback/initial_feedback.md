James is our CEO/Product Owner/Project Manager who while is reasonably technical struggles with the scary nature of the terminal. 

This is his feedback on his first usage of RequireKit for a project:

Stuff I know I would like to include/have needed to do before: 


What are all the questions/info I’ll need upfront? i.e. so I can be prepped for the conversation with everything needed, ideally with ability to just have a template(s) Markdown file(s) to create ahead of starting and feed to the AI to begin.
Ability to skip questions if unknown, ask for clarity/examples, or say “you decide”, e.g. for things like “what level of security do you want?”, when as a PM I don't know, but can describe the audience/users.
Ability to provide an example ticket structure/style and say “follow this”, i.e. to adhere to any existing process/style depending on the company.
Ability to provide project epics and features to the AI for it to create tickets within - e.g. if already in a client proposal, then tasks should follow that structure so progress tracking makes sense throughout.
Ability to just give it a proposal, spreadsheet, or any other document where epics/features/tasks already defined and say “start from this”.
Ability to define task priorities - usually “most tickets so be normal/medium priority, not ‘high’, high is only for blocking tasks, spikes, or core/foundational functionality that must be developed first. Critical only for tasks that are causing errors in live production, or blocking deployments, or classed as urgent by the team, and low for any non-essential/nice-to-have features.”
Ability to create Jira/Linear ticker import files, or ideally a direct API ingestion.
Some process for updating the AI documentation/understanding if/when humans change the tickets - e.g. during a team tech or sprint planning session.

[1:31 PM]…I'm sure there will be more once I get into using it, but these things were my reality on the last project where I tried to use it, and where I just drifted into normal AI chat instead. (edited)

### 3 Critical Gaps

1. **Real Examples Missing**: Must obtain actual complexity scores from TASK-005/006/008
2. **Scope Undefined**: Example verbosity level and format unclear
3. **Phase 2.8 Unclear**: Integration point between TASK-030E-1 and TASK-030E-3

### 4 High-Priority Clarifications

1. Define "three complexity touchpoints" (task-create, Phase 2.7, feature-generate-tasks)
2. Clarify real vs. illustrative examples policy
3. Establish cross-document consistency approach
4. Confirm TASK-008 integration method

### 16 Acceptance Criteria

# Formalize EARS Command

Convert natural language requirements into formal EARS notation.

## Usage
```
/formalize-ears [requirements-file]
```

## EARS Patterns Applied

I'll convert your requirements using the five EARS patterns:

1. **Ubiquitous**: Always active requirements
2. **Event-Driven**: Triggered by events  
3. **State-Driven**: Active during states
4. **Unwanted Behavior**: Error handling
5. **Optional Features**: Configurable functionality

## Process

1. Review natural language requirements
2. Identify appropriate EARS patterns
3. Create formal EARS statements
4. Add measurable criteria
5. Ensure testability

## Output Format

Each requirement will include:
- Unique ID (REQ-XXX)
- EARS statement
- Acceptance criteria
- Priority and status
- Traceability links

## Reference

This command uses the methodology from:
`~/.agentic-flow/instructions/core/ears-methodology.md`

Provide your requirements or specify a file to formalize.

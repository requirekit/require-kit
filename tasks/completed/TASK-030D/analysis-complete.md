## 📋 Clarification Questions (Stakeholder Review Needed)

### Priority 1: Must Clarify Before Implementation

**Question 1: Diagram Format**
```
What is preferred format for visual diagrams in cards?

Options:
  [ ] ASCII art (text-based diagrams)
  [ ] Mermaid diagrams (requires markdown extension)
  [ ] Markdown tables with structured content
  [ ] Combination (ASCII for simple, tables for complex)

Recommendation: ASCII art
Rationale: Universal Markdown support, no external dependencies
```

**Question 2: See Also Reference Scope**
```
How comprehensive should "See Also" sections be?

Options:
  [ ] Minimal (2-3 most critical references)
  [ ] Standard (5-7 related resources)
  [ ] Comprehensive (all related content, 10+)

Recommendation: Standard (5-7 per card)
Rationale: Sufficient navigation without information overload
```

**Question 3: Content Overlap**
```
Acceptable to have some content in multiple cards for clarity?

Options:
  [ ] No overlap - minimize repetition
  [ ] Yes - overlap acceptable if each card serves different purpose

Recommendation: Yes, overlap acceptable
Rationale: Each card serves specific use case; duplication aids discovery
```

**Question 4: Card 1 Line Limit**
```
Strict 150-line limit for task-work-cheat-sheet.md?

Options:
  [ ] Strict 150 lines maximum
  [ ] Flexible up to 175 lines if content critical

Recommendation: Flexible to 175 lines
Rationale: Task-work integrates 8 features; may need extra space
```

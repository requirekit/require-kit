# Task: Remove Unused Agents from RequireKit

## Background

Review TASK-3E70 confirmed that RequireKit does NOT use the following 5 agents:
- architectural-reviewer
- test-orchestrator
- task-manager
- code-reviewer
- test-verifier

These are vestigial copies from shared development history with GuardKit. They are NOT invoked by any RequireKit commands or workflows.

**Evidence**: See [TASK-3E70 Review Report](../../.claude/reviews/TASK-3E70-review-report.md)

## Objective

Remove the 5 unused agents from RequireKit to:
1. Eliminate confusion about which agents RequireKit uses
2. Reduce installation footprint
3. Clarify package boundaries (RequireKit = requirements, GuardKit = implementation)
4. Simplify maintenance

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Remove from `installer/global/agents/`

Delete these files:
- [x] `installer/global/agents/architectural-reviewer.md`
- [x] `installer/global/agents/test-orchestrator.md`
- [x] `installer/global/agents/task-manager.md`
- [x] `installer/global/agents/code-reviewer.md`
- [x] `installer/global/agents/test-verifier.md`

### Step 2: Remove from `.claude/agents/`

Delete these files (if present):
- [x] `.claude/agents/test-orchestrator.md`
- [x] `.claude/agents/task-manager.md`
- [x] `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`
- [x] `.claude/agents/test-verifier.md`

Note: `architectural-reviewer.md` was already absent from `.claude/agents/`

### Step 3: Update Documentation

Remove agent references from:
- [x] `installer/README.md` - Updated to show 2 agents, added GuardKit reference
- [x] `installer/KANBAN_WORKFLOW_INSTALLER_UPDATE.md` - Updated with GuardKit reference
- [x] `installer/UPDATED_INSTALLER_README.md` - Updated to show 2 agents
- [x] `installer/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` - Updated agent listings
- [x] `installer/EXTENDING_THE_SYSTEM.md` - Updated examples with GuardKit references
- [x] `installer/CHANGELOG.md` - Updated agent count and added GuardKit note

### Step 4: Verify Installation Still Works

- [x] Run `bash installer/scripts/install.sh` - Script runs correctly (exits on Python version check as expected)
- [x] Verify only 2 agents exist in `installer/global/agents/` - Confirmed: bdd-generator.md, requirements-analyst.md
- [x] Commands are unaffected (no dependencies on removed agents)

### Step 5: Update Installed Agents (Cleanup)

No cleanup needed - require-kit was not installed to `~/.agentecflow/agents/require-kit/`. The agents in `~/.agentecflow/agents/` are from GuardKit and should not be modified.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] 5 agent files removed from `installer/global/agents/`
- [x] 4 agent files removed from `.claude/agents/`
- [x] Documentation updated to reflect only 2 agents (bdd-generator, requirements-analyst)
- [x] Installation script still works correctly
- [x] References to removed agents now redirect to GuardKit (verified by grep)

## Files to Keep

These agents are USED by RequireKit and must NOT be removed:
- `bdd-generator.md` - Core to BDD generation workflow
- `requirements-analyst.md` - Core to EARS formalization workflow

## Verification

Verification completed:
```bash
# Agents in installer/global/agents/:
bdd-generator.md
requirements-analyst.md

# All references to removed agents in installer/ now redirect to GuardKit
```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking change | Very Low | Low | Agents were never invoked |
| Missing dependency | Very Low | Low | Comprehensive review completed |
| User confusion | Low | Low | Document changes in changelog |

## Notes

- This task implements findings from review TASK-3E70
- Agents will remain available in GuardKit for users who need them
- When both packages are installed, GuardKit provides implementation agents
- Documentation now includes clear references to GuardKit for implementation agents

  COMPLEXITY EVALUATION - TASK-003E
  Comprehensive Testing & Documentation
================================================================================

SCORE: 8/10 (High Complexity - REVIEW REQUIRED)

Force-Review Triggers:
  - First-Time Pattern (Property-Based Testing recommended)
  - Architectural Concerns (YAGNI score 15/25)

Factor Breakdown:
  [CRITICAL] file_complexity: 3/3 - Critical complexity (24+ files)
    Justification: Extensive multi-file coordination across testing
                   infrastructure, unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests,
                   performance tests, and documentation

  [MODERATE] pattern_familiarity: 1/2 - Moderate complexity
    Justification: Mix of familiar patterns (Test Fixture, AAA) and new
                   pattern (Property-Based Testing with hypothesis library)

  [HIGH] risk_level: 2/3 - High risk (3 risk categories)
    Justification:
      1. Architectural over-engineering (990+ → 350-400 tests needed)
      2. Dependency verification required (several modules unverified)
      3. Test maintenance burden (even reduced scope is substantial)

================================================================================
  MANDATORY CHECKPOINT - Phase 2.6 Required
================================================================================

This task requires human review before implementation.

CRITICAL REVIEW ITEMS:
  1. Scope Reduction Validation
     - Original plan: 1050+ tests, 28 documentation files
     - Recommended: 350-400 tests, 6 documentation files
     - Reduction: 60-78% scope decrease
     - Action: Approve which tests/docs are MVP-critical

  2. Dependency Verification
     - Unverified modules: complexity_models, review_modes, plan_templates,
       metrics_collection
     - Action: Verify all modules exist with expected interfaces

  3. Property-Based Testing Decision
     - New pattern recommended by architectural review
     - Requires hypothesis library addition
     - Options: Adopt now / Defer / Pilot in one test file
     - Action: Decide on adoption strategy

  4. Timeline Adjustment
     - Original estimate: 8-10 days
     - Phase 1 actual: 7.5 hours (2x faster than estimate)
     - Reduced scope may enable similar efficiency
     - Action: Validate realistic timeline with buffer

MEDIUM PRIORITY REVIEW ITEMS:
  - Documentation consolidation strategy (28 → 6 files)
  - Test organization and naming conventions
  - Coverage targets validation (Unit 90%, Integration 80%, E2E 70%)

================================================================================
  PHASE 2.6 CHECKPOINT QUESTIONS
================================================================================

BLOCKING QUESTIONS (must answer before Phase 3):
  [ ] Which tests are MVP-critical vs. nice-to-have? (350-400 test priority)
  [ ] Do all dependency modules exist with expected interfaces?
  [ ] Adopt, defer, or pilot property-based testing?
  [ ] Is 8-10 day timeline realistic with reduced scope?

NON-BLOCKING QUESTIONS (recommended to answer):
  [ ] Which 6 documentation files are essential for MVP?
  [ ] Should test organization follow Phase 1 patterns?
  [ ] Are coverage targets (90/80/70/100) appropriate?

================================================================================
  RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

CRITICAL PATH RISKS:
  1. Scope Creep Despite Recommendations
     - Phase 1: 4 files completed successfully
     - Phase 2-4: 20+ files still planned
     - Mitigation: Human review validates MVP-only scope

  2. Dependency Misalignment
     - Several modules not verified to exist
     - Mitigation: Pre-Phase 3 dependency verification

  3. Test Maintenance Burden
     - 350-400 tests still substantial
     - Mitigation: Leverage fixture architecture, parametrized tests

  4. Timeline Optimism
     - Scope reduced but still significant
     - Mitigation: Apply Phase 1 efficiency (2x faster) to Phases 2-4

================================================================================
  RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
  1. Schedule Phase 2.6 human checkpoint session
  2. Prepare dependency verification commands
  3. Review architectural recommendations from Phase 2.5
  4. Identify MVP-critical tests and documentation

CHECKPOINT PREPARATION:
  1. List all planned test files with test counts
  2. Verify dependency module existence
  3. Research property-based testing (hypothesis library)
  4. Estimate Phase 2-4 timeline with reduced scope

POST-CHECKPOINT:
  - Only proceed to Phase 3 after all blocking questions answered
  - Update task metadata with checkpoint decisions
  - Apply approved scope reduction to implementation plan
  - Verify dependencies before writing tests

================================================================================
  ROUTING DECISION
================================================================================

REVIEW MODE: FULL_REQUIRED (Mandatory)
ACTION: Proceed to Phase 2.6 Checkpoint
AUTO-PROCEED: NO

Next Phase: Phase 2.6 Human Checkpoint (required before Phase 3)

================================================================================

This evaluation prioritizes safety and quality over speed. The mandatory
checkpoint ensures architectural concerns are addressed and dependencies are
verified before implementation.

Proceeding to Phase 2.6 human checkpoint...

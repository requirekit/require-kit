Added Graphiti Push step to the Process section with graceful degradation documentation. Updated Output Format section to display Graphiti status and completeness score. Enhanced Validation section to explicitly document that features always belong to epics (REQ-004) and epic parameter is required. All changes follow the same pattern established in epic-create.md (TASK-RK01-002).",

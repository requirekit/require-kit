Added Requirements Refinement as core component #4, updated development flow to include refinement and Graphiti sync steps, documented all three organisation patterns (Direct, Features, Mixed) with detailed hierarchy structures and when-to-use guidance, added all new commands (/epic-refine, /feature-refine, /requirekit-sync) with descriptions, and added Iterative Refinement as key principle #6. State Management was renumbered from section 4 to section 5 to accommodate the new refinement component.",
